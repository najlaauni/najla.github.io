<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
Programming Technique I introduced me to the fundamentals of programming using C++. Throughout the course, I learned how to write structured programs, apply control structures, functions, and basic problem-solving techniques. One of the main challenges I faced was debugging errors and understanding program logic when the output was not as expected. Despite this, the hands-on lab sessions and continuous coding practice helped me improve my programming skills and logical flow. This course increased my confidence in coding and motivated me to further enhance my programming proficiency through self-practice and additional projects.
