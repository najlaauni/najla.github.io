  <h2>📝 Summary</h2>
  <p>
    This poster case study assignment (worth 40%) requires students to work in groups of six to eight members to identify 
    and analyse a current issue related to integrity and corruption. Each group must conduct a case study using either interviews or surveys, 
    limited strictly to students who are currently enrolled in the course. Groups are required to choose different issues 
    from one another to ensure originality. The poster of an academic type having the dimensions of A2 will be the final product which is going to be 
    submitted in the form of a soft copy by the end of the tenth week. The best poster belonging to every section will get the chance of 
    being printed and exhibited during Integrity Week. The content of the poster has to be the following: an introduction consisting of background, chronology, 
    critical incidents, and objectives; a literature review covering the concepts of integrity and corruption with local and global comparisons; the methodology
    section describing the respondents and the data collection method; findings and discussion; conclusion and recommendations; and a reference list. 
    The poster must be based on facts, backed by academic citations, and clearly presented on a single A2 page.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
The first thing my group members and I did was to have a several face-to-face and online discussions to select an appropriate issue that met the task requirements before getting into the design. We also did background research to clarify the problem better, which enabled us to set our objectives, create survey questions, and arrange a good way of data collection. 
<br><br>
  
We chose to divide the responsibilities equally so that no member of the team would be left out in the process of working on the project. There were people who concentrated on collecting data, others who were responsible for interpreting and reporting the survey results, while the rest of the team was involved in writing and structuring the content after we had found a proper template for the poster in Canva. This teamwork was a great lesson for me on how valuable teamwork, effective communication and taking responsibility are for getting a group task done successfully.
<br><br>
  
During the process of making the poster, we briefly presented key parts like the methodology and findings of our research in a very straightforward and simple manner. A lot of our time went to re-organizing the layout, verifying the information, and making sure the references were correct. After the poster submission, we gave a presentation of our work in the lecture which was a great help in increasing my confidence and in developing my skill of presenting ideas to people in a clear way.
<br><br>

In conclusion, the assignment was a hard one but it still was a good practice for my research and presentation skills. What is more important is that I have realized the power that integrity has in curbing corruption in the society which made this task a really good learning experience for me.
