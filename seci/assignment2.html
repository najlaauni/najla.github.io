  <h2>📘 Task Description</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment must be done in a group consisting of 3 members which has been arranged by our lecturer. 
    We need to solve all the questions by writing them neatly and readily on the plain A4 paper. 
    However, because the due date is on our midterm break, we need to send it through eLearning as a soft copy. 
    From this assignment, we have been required to :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>View and understand the provided questions</li>
      <li>Answer all 7 questions :<br>
        - list down the element, domain and range of R. Also, draw the diagraph of the relation and determine whether the relation is assymetric or not.<br>
        - list all possible member of R and justify the answer.<br>
        - construct the matrix of relation, list in-degrees and out-degrees of all vertices, and determine whether the relation is a partial order relation or not.<br>
        - determine whether the function is one–one, onto, or bijective.<br>
        - find the inverse and composition function.<br>
        - write the recurrence relation and use it to find the value of 𝑃5.<br>
        - write a recursive algorithm to calculate the nᵗʰ term of the sequence and trace the recursive steps to compute 𝑠4 .
      </li>
      <li>Write all the names of members of the group on the front page</li>
      <li>Submit the assignment as a soft copy through eLearning</li>
    </ul>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
By finishing Assignment 1 on Set Theory and Logic, I cleared my way through the fog of understanding the most important concepts that are the basis of discrete mathematics. The activities of going through sets, proving identities of sets via the laws, and applying the formulas in solving the problems were the areas that I got the most for my logical and mathematical reasoning skill.
<br><br>
  
A very challenging aspect of the task was to demonstrate the truth of the assertions and to disclose all the provided laws, thus demanding of me a meticulous and methodical procedure. However, the challenge developed my problem-solving discipline and patience with detail. The activity of constructing truth tables for the verification of the logical equivalence of compound propositions was one way to grasp better the working together of the logical operators and the formal justification of the conclusions.
<br><br>
  
Working in a group allowed me not only to express my thoughts to the rest of the team but also to consider the issue from various angles. The teamwork improved my Communicating skills and also provided me with the experience of learning from others without giving up my responsibility of understanding the solutions. All in all, this assignment brought up my self-assurance in dealing with logical proofs and set-related problems. It also made me realize the necessity of being strong in the fundamentals as these concepts would be the key in unlocking the door to more advanced topics in future courses.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide additional sample questions or worked examples</li>
  <li>Provide clear marking rubrics</li>
  <li>Allow the use of typed mathematical solutions or digital tools such as equation editors</li>
</ul>
