<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
Digital Logic introduced me to the fundamental concepts of digital systems, including logic gates, Boolean algebra, and combinational circuits. This course helped me understand how hardware components function at a basic level and how logical operations are applied in digital devices. One of the difficulties I faced was visualizing circuit behavior and minimizing logic expressions. However, through practice and simulations, I gradually developed a better understanding of digital circuit design. This course provided a solid foundation for hardware-related subjects and enhanced my problem-solving and analytical skills.</p>
