  The task for this assignment was to construct a flow chart based on 2 sets that were given by the lecturer.<br>

  <h2>📘 Task Description</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment must be done in pairs which means a group consisting of 2 members. 
    We got set 2 which needs to construct a flow chart that develops a Loan Calculator to estimate a monthly installment and help to plan finances. 
    From set 2, we have been required to :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>View and understand the provided output of the set that we got</li>
      <li>Construct a flow chart that has the same output as a set that we got</li>
      <li>Apply :<br>
        - Branching/selection (if..else)<br>
        - Loop/repetition (repeat..until/do..while)<br>
        - User-defined function flow chart. Besides the main function flow chart, at least one more other function flow chart. Use appropriate arguments for the function.</li>
      <li>Save the file using the required naming format</li>
      <li>Submit the flowchart through the eLearning platform</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
The first assignment was to create a flowchart for a Loan Calculator which made me realize the application of logical structures in problem-solving and program planning. I understood how to decompose a practical problem into unambiguous and methodical steps by switching the supplied set output to a flowchart.
<br><br>
  
This assignment strengthened my understanding of branching, looping, and user-defined functions. Applying selection statements such as if–else helped me manage different conditions, while loops allowed repeated calculations until certain requirements were met. Designing an additional function flowchart besides the main flowchart improved my understanding of modular design and how functions help organize a program more efficiently.
<br><br>
  
Working in pairs encouraged collaboration and discussion, especially when deciding the most logical flow for calculations and conditions. By means of this process, my confidence in visualizing algorithms and confirming the flowchart to generate accurate and consistent outputs was increased. In general, this task not only improved my logical thinking ability but also gave me a practical experience in algorithm design which will be beneficial for future programming-related subjects.
