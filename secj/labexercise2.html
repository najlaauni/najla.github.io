  <h2>📘 Task Description</h2>
  <p>
    I chose set 1 which needs to write a complete C++ program that reads an integer number and then calculates the sum of its digits. 
    After that, identify whether the sum of digits for the integer is a multiple of 3, 4, and/or 5. 
    Also, I should use operator divide (/) and modulus (%) and also post-test loop to answer this question. 
    From set 1, I have been required to :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>View and understand the provided output of the set I chose</li>
      <li>Write a complete C++ program that has the same output as a set that I chose</li>
      <li>Save the file using the required naming format</li>
      <li>Submit the complete C++ program through the eLearning platform</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
In Lab Exercise 2, I got to use my algorithmic thinking skills when I implemented a whole C++ program based on the problem that was given. The program, which took an integer, found the sum of its digits, and then tested if the sum were a multiple of 3, 4, or 5, helped me a lot with the concepts of loops, conditionals and even arithmetic operators like division (/) and modulo (%).
<br><br>
  
Using a post-test loop made me realize the difference between the check after and before the execution; thus making sure that the digit processing will take place at least once. This move was also a sign of improving my capacity to convert a flowchart or computer logic into real C++ code thereby strengthening the bond between program design and coding.
<br><br>
  
The physical lab experience of working under strict timing conditions for the lab increased my focus, time management, and debugging skills. This lab exercise, in general, was a boost to my confidence in writing structured C++ programs and also in solving numerical problems efficiently.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide sample input and output cases before the session begins</li>
  <li>Allow a brief feedback or code review session after submission</li>
  <li>Offer practice questions before the lab session</li>
</ul>
