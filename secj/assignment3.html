  <h2>📘 Task Description</h2>
  <p>
    This assignment must be done in pairs which means a group consisting of 2 members. 
    We got set 2 which needs to write a complete C++ program  to calculate the total and average number of students' intake, enrolment, and output in public universities for 2015. Then, find the highest and lowest number of 
    students' intake, enrolment, and output. Finally, find the range of the number of students' intake, enrolment, and output. From set 2, we have been required to :<br>
    <ul>
      <li>View and understand the provided output of the set that we got</li>
      <li>Apply :<br>
        - function.<br>
        - input file.<br>
        - output file.</li>
      <li>Save the file using the required naming format</li>
      <li>Submit the complete C++ program through the eLearning platform</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As part of Assignment 2, I had to write a complete C++ program for a Loan Calculator, which was a great way for me to connect algorithm design with programming. Besides that, I learned how to code a logic through the process of creating a working C++ application out of the output requirements given.
<br><br>
  
This task not only confirmed my understanding of C++ conditions, loops, and user-defined functions, but also expanded it. The application could use different ways of expressing the same thing through if– else statements, and the loops made it possible to calculate over and over as needed, which was great! Works to my advantage that I created several user-defined functions besides the main one because I got the chance of realizing the significance of modular programming and code reuse which meant that the program was readable and maintainable in the long run.
<br><br>
  
The partnership atmosphere was great as it made communication and discussion of problems possible, especially when it came to the debugging of errors and program logic improvement. From such a course, I also got the chance of gaining debugging, logical reasoning, and structured C++ coding skills. Be it as it may, this mission gave me more assurance in creating full programs capable of solving real-life problems.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Introduce a code review or feedback session before final submission</li>
  <li>Encourage the use of version control tools such as GitHub for submission or progress tracking</li>
</ul>
