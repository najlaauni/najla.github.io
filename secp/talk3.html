<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
The industry talk by speaker from PPG provided useful insights into how business intelligence (BI) and information systems are applied in real industrial settings. The speaker started off by PPG introduction as a worldwide chemical corporation dealing with the manufacture of paints, coatings, and silica products for a variety of markets including tyres and rubber industry.
<br><br>
  
Then, the speaker revealed the function of Power BI as a platform for reporting and analytics that is employed to convert raw data into significant data for the purpose of decision-making. In order to facilitate the understanding of the concept, the speaker resorted to a dessert making analogy to illustrate the way data travels from different sources to the end users. According to this analogy, the ingredients stood for data such as sales and customer data, suppliers were the data sources like SQL Server and SAP, logistics represented networks like VPN and the Internet, freezer represented storage like databases and data warehouses in PPG, baking appliances were the hardware such as servers and cloud compute, recipe book were the software such as Power BI, chefs were the BI developers, and customers were the business users.
<br><br>

Moreover, the speaker presented Power BI's three main components which were Power BI Desktop, Power BI Services, and Power BI Mobile. She also, in passing, talked about the system architecture and the way VPN settings can be altered to make sure that only the people who have the permission will be able to reach the specific reports and information.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As a first-year student, attending this industry talk was a truly eye-opening experience for me. This talk was very enlightening for me since it allowed me to see the practical side of the theoretical concepts we learn in class. The dessert-making analogy was particularly useful as it made the more complicated issues like data pipelines, storage systems, and reporting tools very easy and straightforward to comprehend.
<br><br>
  
Moreover, the talk had led me to think that information systems were not just about programming, however, they are actually about integrating geographical and software-based sets of computer and communication infrastructures that support business operations. My seeing Power BI in action at PPG, a global company, has made me realize how significant the role of data analytics and business intelligence has become in the eliminating of inefficiency, waste, and costs in the modern organizations’ batting.
<br><br>

The speaker's message, that was backed up by Dr. Aryati, did also remind me that the nature of technology is such that continuous learning is a must. Even when some topics appear to be burdensome or less appealing, their mastering is a prerequisite for long-term growth. The talk not only encouraged me to devote more attention to my technical knowledge, especially in the areas of data and analytics but also to the development of my communication and soft skills so that I become more prepared for the industry’s challenges in the future. All in all, this session has motivated me even more to take full advantage of the learning opportunities that UTM has to offer and to constantly upskill myself for both academic success and career readiness.
