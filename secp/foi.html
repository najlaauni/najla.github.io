<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
Attending the Festival of Ideas (FOI) 2025 at PICC was a truly inspiring and enriching experience for me as a first-year student. Throughout the event, I was exposed to innovation, creativity, and meaningful discussions that made me reflect on how technology and ideas shape the future. Exploring the booths, interacting with exhibitors, and seeing how fields like AI, sustainability, culture, and creative design come together gave me a deeper appreciation of how broad and impactful innovation can be.
<br><br>
  
The talks and forums were among the most memorable parts of FOI. Listening to experts discuss digital transformation, the AI-driven economy, aerospace advancements, and Malaysia’s direction for the future gave me new perspectives on how fast technology is evolving. Watching the Prime Minister, Dato’ Seri Anwar Ibrahim, through my friend's video deliver his message about youth innovation made the experience even more powerful, his words motivated me to think bigger and push myself beyond classroom learning. I also enjoyed the hands-on activities, like decorating cupcakes and learning popcorn packaging, which made the event fun, interactive, and different from the usual academic routine.
<br><br>

What made FOI special was not just the event itself, but the entire experience. Traveling from UTM to Putrajaya early in the morning with my coursemates felt like an adventure. Being in a new environment, meeting students from various universities, and reconnecting with friends made the event more meaningful. Overall, FOI 2025 reminded me that learning is not limited to lectures, but it also comes from exploring new places, interacting with people, and being open to new ideas. As a Data Engineering student, this experience strengthened my motivation to use technology creatively and contribute to innovation that can make a real impact.
