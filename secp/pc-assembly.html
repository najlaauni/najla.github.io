<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As a first-year student, the PC Assembly and Disassembly Lab Session was a truly eye-opening experience for me. It was my first time opening up a computer and seeing its internal components up close. The instructor took us through the process and showed how to handle sensitive hardware like motherboard, RAM, power supply, and hard disk with care. Watching the demonstration made me realise how much precision and care are required when dealing with computer parts.

During the Lab Session, we need to work together as a group of six to practice disassembling and reassembling the PC. We took turns handling different components, checking connections, and ensuring the system could boot properly after reassembly. It felt exciting to finally see the lecture material we usually learn from slides being turned into such a real hands-on activity.

Besides gaining technical knowledge through this session, I discovered that I am the kind of person who likes to touch, inspect, and install each part by myself to get the full picture of how the components work together to build a system. This session also helped strengthen teamwork, communication, and patience, especially when sharing tools and coordinating tasks. I noticed that my work with hardware had become more confident and comfortable. Moreover, I am thankful to our lecturer, Dr. Aryati bt Bakri, for providing us with this chance to explore computer hardware hands-on and deepen our understanding of how a PC works. To me, this lab session was an impactful and unforgettable experience for me, and has motivated me to continue improving my technical skills as I continue my journey in the tech field!

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Include more time for hands-on practice so every student can handle more components individually</li>
  <li>Provide extra tools or equipment sets to reduce waiting time during group work</li>
  <li>Add a short troubleshooting segment (e.g., PC fails to boot — identify the cause) to strengthen real-world problem-solving skills</li>
  <li>Share a brief guide or checklist for students to review before and after the lab</li>
</ul>
