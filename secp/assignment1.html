<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
From November 28 to November 29, 2025, Dewan Seminar, and UTMDigital opened the doors to their yearly event called UTMDigital Open Day 2025, attended by nearly a hundred students who were interested in witnessing UTM's digital transformation. The activities encompassed demonstrations, hands-on experiences, and discussions that showcased how digital innovation was used in the fields of academics and administration at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia facility.<br>
<br>
  
  The programme comprised four key talks that reflected the core components of UTMDigital’s digital ecosystem:<br>
  <strong>Information System</strong> - Presented by Hj. Madradzi Bin Muhamad from the Division of Digital Innovation (DDI), 
  this session focused on the role of information systems in managing student data, academic records, and digital services. 
  Emphasis was placed on system integration and the importance of good system design to enhance user experience and service efficiency.<br>
  <strong>Digital Infrastructure</strong> - Delivered by Mohd Hafiz Muhammad Nasir from the Division of Digital Architecture (DDA), 
  this talk highlighted UTMDigital’s continuous efforts in strengthening digital infrastructure. The session covered the advancement of network systems 
  and infrastructure development to ensure scalability, reliability, and secure digital operations across the university.<br>
  <strong>Data Engineering</strong> - This session led by Zahari Supene of DDA, dealt with the basics of data engineering and presented data pipelines, data integrity, 
  and employment prospects in the domain as the core points. The lecture gave a clearer picture of the industry expectations and also provided valuable tips for students 
  who are going to take up data-related positions in future.<br>
  <strong>System Development</strong> - Helmee Bin Yaacob from DDI discussed system development practices at UTM, including platforms such as the myUTM Portal and UTMSmart.
  The session covered project management approaches, including Predictive and Adaptive methods, Agile Biz-DevOps methodology, and best practices adopted 
  by the Project Management Office (PMO) to deliver effective digital solutions.
  
  <br><br>
The four areas mentioned above are a part of UTMDigital’s integrated strategy for digital transformation, which consists of the use of information systems, infrastructure, data engineering, and system development to help UTM achieve its strategic objectives. Open Day was a great way to get firsthand knowledge of digital projects in the real world and it also underscored the role of digital innovation as a factor that will influence the future of higher education.</p>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As a first-year student, the visit to UTMDigital Open Day was a truly meaningful experience for me. During the visit, I had the chance to look around a lot of interesting booths featuring innovative projects and creative ideas. It was such a valuable experience to learn, connect, and get inspired by passionate individuals and organizations. Not only that, I was also able to communicate directly with UTMDigital staff by interviewing them and learning from their real-world experiences, which made the visit even more valuable.
<br><br>
  
For my part in the project, I took on the role of designer and researcher. I was responsible for deciding how the vlog would look, taking some photos and videos, and making sure everything captured represented our experience well. After filming, I organised all the materials and sent them to my group member, Nurain Nabilah, to compile it. We also decided how to make the video look attractive and fun, but still follow the rules. This made the editing process smoother and kept everything neat and organised. I also actively participated in the Q&A sessions, which allowed me to engage with the staff directly and deepen my understanding of their work. Plus, I was delighted to receive a gift, which made the experience even more memorable.
<br><br>
  
Besides gaining new knowledge through these tasks, I realised how much I enjoy planning, designing, and presenting ideas visually. The event also helped strengthen my communication skills, boosted my confidence, and improved my teamwork with my group members. I felt inspired by the professionalism of the UTMDigital staff and motivated to develop my own skills further. Also, I am grateful to the UTMDigital staff and our lecturer, Dr. Aryati bt Bakri, for giving us the opportunity to understand more about campus IT operations. This visit was an incredibly enlightening and memorable experience, and I can’t wait to put what I’ve learnt into practice as I continue my journey in the tech field!

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
    <p>
      Provide better signage or a digital map of the booths so students can plan their visit and not miss important sections.
