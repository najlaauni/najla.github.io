<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
  The ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 is aimed to be the primary major gathering dealing with quantum science and technology in Southeast Asia region as 
  it will be the first conference of this type. The summit was a significant move to prepare the area for the quantum era as it gathered diverse attendees such 
  as government representatives, scientists, industry partners, and more than 2,600 students. The summit takes place during the International 
  Year of Quantum Science and Technology 2025 and it is consistent with the ASEAN Plan of Action on Science, Technology and Innovation (APASTI).<br><br>
  The summit brought to light some cornerstones of ASEAN's quantum growth:<br>
  <strong>Quantum Research collaborations</strong> - There were new partnerships consisting of universities, research institutions, and commercial entities that comprised the signing of agreements intended for the areas of quantum computing, communication, and biology.<br>
  <strong>Quantum Communication Infrastructure</strong> - The secure quantum communication links and the cross-border communication under the Johor–Singapore Special Economic Zone initiative were among the technologies presented by UTM.<br>
  <strong>Education and Talent Development</strong> - The participation of more than 2,600 students is a sign of ASEAN's resolve in enhancing quantum literacy and nurturing a competent future workforce.<br>
<br>Through these measures, the convolution of efforts has implied a big step towards the positioning of ASEAN as an emerging world player in the quantum innovation arena.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
Attending the ASEAN Quantum Summit 2025 as a first-year student was truly eye-opening for me. It gave me a clear understanding of how important quantum technology will be for the future of ASEAN, especially in areas like cybersecurity, communication, and advanced computing. I was amazed to see that all ASEAN Member States, together with international partners, are now investing seriously in building a shared quantum ecosystem. The summit also highlighted an important message for my own development: succeeding in the technology field requires more than just academic achievement. It also demands curiosity, continuous learning, hands-on experience, and the willingness to explore new, emerging fields like quantum science.
<br><br>
  
Throughout this sessions, I learned how quantum communication, quantum computing, and quantum sensing are becoming foundational technologies for the next generation of digital infrastructure. The demonstrations of quantum-secure networks helped me understand how critical security and data protection will be in the future. Meanwhile, the research collaborations signed between universities and industry partners showed me that quantum development requires strong teamwork across countries, disciplines, and expertise. I also realised that quantum science is deeply connected to mathematics, physics, and data engineering fields I am already interested in, which made the summit even more meaningful to me.
<br><br>
  
After attending the summit, my interest in quantum technology grew much stronger because it is a field with tremendous potential and long-term impact. I believe this area will continue to expand rapidly in ASEAN, and being involved early could open many exciting opportunities for research, postgraduate studies, and future careers. The summit inspired me to strengthen my mathematical and technical foundation so that I can one day contribute to the development of quantum technologies in the region. Overall, I am grateful to UTM and all the organisers for giving students like me the chance to be part of such a significant event. This experience truly motivated me to keep improving myself and to explore how I can play a meaningful role in ASEAN’s quantum future!

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
  <li>Include hands-on quantum demos or beginner-friendly workshops so students can better understand how quantum computing and communication work in practice.</li>
  <li>Provide clear career roadmaps showing the skills, courses, and pathways needed to enter the quantum technology field in ASEAN.</li>
  <li>Share follow-up materials such as slides, recorded talks, or beginner guides to help students continue learning after the summit.</li>
</ul>
