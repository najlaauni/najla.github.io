<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
  The Design thinking project called "CampusSpot: Smart Parking on Campus" was a product of the TIS (SECP1513) course. The project targeted the UTM students and staff's parking and traffic problems especially during peak hours. 
  The team used the Design Thinking process to develop a solution that is both practical and user-friendly, hence facilitating campus mobility and time management.<br><br>
  The project was executed through five phases which mirrored the five stages of Design Thinking:<br>
  <strong>Empathy</strong> - It was dedicated to uncovering the actual user issues through surveys and interviews with students and lecturers that had been through parking problems on campus and knew about them.<br>
  <strong>Define</strong> - The gathered information was combined to pinpoint very accurately the main problems like not having access to real-time parking information, traffic jams, places where it was not safe to park, and bad time management.<br>
  <strong>Ideate</strong> - Brainstorming sessions were held to come up with various solution ideas, and then they were assessed based on their feasibility, accessibility, and user impact, leading to the choice of a mobile application for smart parking.<br>
  <strong>Prototype</strong> - The CampusSpot app went through developing a working prototype with the help of digital design software, which showcased real-time parking availability, smart navigation, traffic flow tracking, and notification alerting features, and more.<br>
  <strong>Test</strong> - The user testing and demonstrations were performed to get feedback, confirm acceptability, and measure the solution's capability of actually dealing with the campus parking problems.<br>
In conclusion, the project was a reflection of how design thinking application could be the way of handling the real problems by making them structured, thus the technology-driven solutions that are based on the user needs were the resultant.</p>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
The Design Thinking project participation turned out to be a significant and fruitful experience for me as a first-year student of the Faculty of Computing. I was very pleasantly surprised to find in this project that a solution to a problem related to computer science is not necessarily the result of a technical process but simply can be a matter of fully understanding the users, recognizing the real needs of the user and coming up with a solution that has an actual impact.
<br><br>

Listening to the users during the Empathy and Define phases, I realized myself that it was critical, as the problems were already going to be solved. I the users actively participating in the process, and auditing the qualitative data very meticulously before going on with the solution, so to make them feel and actually be a part of the project. The research through surveys and interviews made me realize that the parking problem on campus is not only an inconvenience but also a drain that impairs people’s health and, hence, the quality of life, e.g. through stress, late arrivals to meetings and/or classes, and low productivity in general. This phase helped me quite a lot in developing the skill of putting myself in others' shoes rather than in the developer's shoes.
<br><br>
  
The Ideate and Prototype phases presented me with opportunities to practice the co-solving of problems and the use of imagination. Among other things, I learned how to give a lot of ideas, weigh the different options rationally, and finally, turn the vague notions into a real, physical product, that is, a prototype. The whole process of creating CampusSpot opened my eyes to the fact that all the aspects of a system, i.e. features, user interface design, and functionality, should be in harmony with one another in order to provide the user with a seamless experience.
<br><br>
  
During the Testing phase, I came to see that criticism is the mother of improvement. Watching the users’ interaction with the prototype made me realize that everybody has to go through the refinement process, even good ideas. All things considered, this project had a great impact on the enhancement of my teamwork, communication, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. Moreover, it amplified my ambition to become a data engineer in the future, as I desire to be working with data-centric and user-centric systems, which is a new trend in the industry.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Allocate more time for user testing with a larger and more diverse group of users to gather deeper insights and improve system accuracy.</li>
  <li>Integrate real-time campus data sources, such as actual traffic sensors or parking systems, to enhance the realism and reliability of the prototype.</li>
  <li>Provide clearer system flow diagrams and technical architecture to better illustrate how data is collected, processed, and displayed within the application.</li>
  <li>Include additional accessibility features, such as voice navigation or enhanced support for disabled users, to make the system more inclusive.</li>
</ul>
