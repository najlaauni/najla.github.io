  <h2>📌 Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This lab session focused on the construction and analysis of a synchronous digital counter using JK flip-flops and basic logic gates. The main emphasis 
    of the experiment was to understand how synchronous counters operate, how all flip-flops respond simultaneously to a common clock signal, 
    and how external control inputs influence the counting behavior.<br><br>

    Besides constructing the physical circuit on a breadboard, students were required to analyze the circuit behavior by completing the next-state table, 
    sketching the state diagram, and identifying the fundamental properties of the counter. This lab bridges theoretical knowledge of 
    sequential logic with hands-on circuit implementation.

  <h2>🧪 Laboratory Work</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Part 1 — JK Flip-Flop Familiarization</strong><br>
    By setting the J, K, PRE, CLR inputs manually, the students first observed the behaviour of the 7476 JK flip-flop. The output response was observed through LEDs 
    while applying clock pulses. This step helped students understand synchronous and asynchronous operations, including reset, set, hold, and toggle conditions.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Part 2 — Circuit Construction</strong><br> 
    Using the provided schematic, students assembled the synchronous counter circuit on a breadboard. All ICs were properly connected to Vcc and GND, and the clock input 
    was supplied from the ETS-5000 Digital Kit. Switches were used to control the input variable X, while LEDs indicated the present and next states of the counter.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Part 3 — Next-State Analysis</strong><br>
    The behavior of the counter was investigated by observing the output states for all combinations of present state (Q1, Q0) and input X. The observations were recorded 
    in a next-state table, which served as the basis for identifying the counting sequence.<br><br>
    
    <strong>Part 4 — State Diagram</strong><br>
    The state diagram of the counter was sketched by the students based on the finished next-state table. The diagram illustrates very well that the counter 
    moves through all states in order when X = 1, whereas it stays in its present state when X = 0.<br><br>

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As a first-year student, this lab session on synchronous digital counters gave me valuable hands-on experience with sequential logic circuits. Before this experiment, my comprehension of counters was practically and not beyond the level of diagrams and truth tables. The physical construction of the circuit allowed me to visualize the collaboration of flip-flops and logic gates in a genuine system.
<br><br>
  
This lab was an educational experience for me as I learned that one of the main features of a synchronous counter is that the clock is common to all the flip-flops, resulting in the simultaneous occurrence of transitions. The process of making the next-state table and drawing the state diagram gave me a clear understanding of the influence of control inputs, like switch X, on the counter operation.
<br><br>
  
Moreover, I became sure of my skills in pointing out the counter characteristics like the amount of states and if it’s a recycling counter or not. In summary, this laboratory exercise increased my knowledge of the sequential circuits and made me able to relate the theoretical concepts with the actual circuit behavior.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide a brief demonstration on JK flip-flop operation before starting the lab.</li>
      <li>Allocate more time for students to analyze and discuss the next-state table and state diagram.</li>
      <li>Include additional example circuits to help students compare synchronous and asynchronous counters.</li>
      <li>Provide clearer labeling on the circuit diagram to reduce wiring errors during construction.</li>
    </ul>
