  <h2>📌 Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The lab session presented the fundamental principles of combinational logic circuits. Besides, it was mainly about the practical aspect 
    of working with wiring, breadboarding, and using real hardware testing to verify the behaviors of the logic gates. The main 
    objective of this laboratory was to construct basic logic circuits and then check their behavior using switches and 
    LEDs in order to confirm their truth tables.<br>
    We used several IC logic gates such as:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>7408 — AND Gate</li>
      <li>7404 — NOT Gate (Inverter)</li>
      <li>7432 — OR Gate</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>🎯 Objectives</h2>
  <p>
    The objectives of this lab session are to introduce the student to:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>basic bread boarding and wiring techniques.</li>
      <li>the use of input switches and output LEDs in generating truth tables for a combinational logic circuit.</li>
      <li>verify the characteristic of the basic gates.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>🧪 Laboratory Work</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Part 1 — AND Gate Circuit</strong> - The combinational logic circuit was built using the 7408 IC and verified by testing all possible input combinations with switches.<br>
    <strong>Part 2 — NAND Gate Circuit</strong> - The circuit was built by connecting the 7408 IC and 7404 IC and was verified by comparing its resulting truth table, which represents an NAND logic function.<br>
    <strong>Part 3 — Combined Logic Circuit</strong> - The constructed circuit, which used 7408 IC, 7404 IC, and 7432 IC to implement a multi-gate logic function, was simplified through Boolean algebra or visual methods, demonstrating that the complex circuit behaved identically to a much simpler single-gate equivalent.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
As a first-year student, the Digital Logic Lab session was a fun and eye-opening experience for me. It was my first hands-on exposure to digital logic using real hardware such as breadboards, switches, and LEDs. Before this lab, logic gates felt very abstract because everything was learned on paper. Being able to physically build the circuits helped me clearly understand how theoretical logic gates behave in real hardware.
<br><br>
  
During the lab session, I learned how to properly connect wires on the breadboard and ensure the circuit was neat and organised to avoid errors. I also realised the importance of checking the IC orientation carefully and verifying logic outputs using the mode switch and LEDs. These steps required patience and attention to detail, but they helped me better understand how small mistakes can affect the entire circuit.
<br><br>
  
Besides gaining technical knowledge, this lab helped me connect theory with physical implementation, making the learning process more interactive and meaningful. I now feel more confident in handling logic gate circuits and interpreting truth tables based on real measurements rather than purely theoretical assumptions. Overall, I am grateful for this hands-on experience as it strengthened my understanding of digital logic and motivated me to keep improving my practical skills in the field of electronics.
