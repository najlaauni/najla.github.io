<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
  From 16th to 18th January 2026, I was fortunate enough to be involved in the Gift Unit within the team of CODE'26. My role was that of a 'dulang girl' at 
  HCI Open Day and at the Closing Ceremony where I helped in the presentation of gifts and tokens of appreciation. Through this, I got to meet students 
  from various faculties and along with the collaboration, dedication, and positive vibes that made the event successful.
  <br><br>
  The key points I learned from the experience are:<br>
  <strong>Collaboration & Teamwork</strong> - Efficiently coordinating with the fellow team members for the trouble-free gift presentation and event operation.<br>
  <strong>Responsibility & Organization</strong> - Getting to know the way of systematically arranging, labeling, and distributing gifts with accuracy and timeliness as the other ones were done.<br>
  <strong>Community & Engagement</strong> - Realizing the importance of nurturing relationships and of being there for one another during the studies, thus making the experience unforgettable and inclusive.<br><br>
  To sum up, CODE’26 was not only an event but also an invitation to the world of commitment, teamwork, and significant happenings made.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
Being a member of the CODE’26 as Gift Unit was both a challenge and a source of rewards. I started to see that even the smallest tasks like giving out presents might change the total event flow significantly. The event taught me some of the most important things in life such as responsibility, teamwork, and communication which probably are not only applicable to events but to life and future professional careers.
<br><br>
  
The event told me that the success measure is not just results but also through the working together of the people, their support for each other, and their positive attitude even if the situation is difficult. I learned to be versatile, alert, and proactive and I got to value even more the collective power that is very often the unsung hero behind the success of such large-scale events.
<br><br>
  
In short, this experience was a stimulator for my personal development, a great practice for my soft skills, and a collection of nice memories added to my university journey.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<p>
  Pre-Event Training - Conducting a short orientation or simulation for all Gift Unit members could improve confidence and efficiency during the event.
