<h2>📝 Summary</h2>
<p>
  SUSKOM’25 is a yearly sports occasion performed by and for Computer Science students of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), held from 19 to 21 December 2025. 
  Through various competitive sports activities, the event aimed at promoting unity, sportsmanship, and collaboration among computing students from different faculties 
  and batches. In addition to competition, SUSKOM’25 became a breeding ground for leadership, teamwork, and respect to be built in the diverse academic community.<br><br>
  Being part of the SUSKOM’25 team, I was able to help with the event running by being a Line Judge during the badminton tournament. This job needed a lot of 
  care, fairness, and accountability to ensure that the matches were held in a smooth and professional manner. The event brought out three main values:<br>
  <strong>Sportsmanship & Integrity</strong> - Promoting the honesty and fairness of students through rules and competition.<br>
  <strong>Collaboration & Teamwork</strong> - Making a strong cooperation between the organizers, officials, and participants of different faculties and backgrounds.<br>
  <strong>Community Engagement</strong> - Strong ties beyond the classroom through shared experiences, cooperation, and mutual support were formed.<br>
  To sum up, SUSKOM’25 was not just a sports competition, but a community-driven event that showcased unity and professionalism among the Computer Science 
  students and reflected their values.

<h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
<p>
To be a part of SUSKOM'25 as a crew member was an experience full of meaning and also very challenging since it took me out of my comfort zone. Being a Line Judge helped me see how even a supporting role is very important to the judging side of the event and the whole event running well. This experience helped me to understand that the qualities of responsibility, focus, and integrity are very critical not only in sports but also in professional life.
<br><br>
  
The whole event shone a light on the sportsmanship of the different faculties, races and academic backgrounds that were participating and this was one of the things that inspired me the most. The games might have been competitive but respect and teamwork were norms throughout. This made me stronger in my belief that winning is not necessarily the only measure of success, but rather, how persons behave, communicate and help each other out in tough times.
<br><br>
  
SUSKOM'25 showed me that there is value in teamwork beyond the immediate influence of the class. I found communicating and being flexible to be necessary skills when working with others towards a common goal. The whole process was a good reminder that the soft skills of a computer science student such as teamwork, fairness, and leadership are at par with the technical ones. Therefore, SUSKOM'25 was a marvelous learning experience that not only helped me grow personally but also made my university life richer.

<h2>💡 Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
<p>
  Additional Training for Official - Conducting a brief training or simulation session for referees and line judges before the event could increase confidence and ensure consistent decision-making.
