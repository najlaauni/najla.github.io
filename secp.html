The Design Thinking project exposed me to a user-centered approach in problem solving.
Through ideation and low-fidelity prototyping, I learned how to identify user needs and
transform abstract ideas into practical solutions. Although it was challenging to convert
ideas into meaningful designs, the project enhanced my creativity, teamwork, and communication skills.
