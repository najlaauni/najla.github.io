  <h2>🪞 Reflection</h2>
  <p>
  The Integrity and Anti-Corruption course emphasized the importance of ethical values, integrity, and accountability in both personal and professional life. Through discussions, case studies, and reflections, I gained a deeper awareness of corruption issues and their impact on society and organizations. The course encouraged me to reflect on moral decision-making and responsible behavior. Although the course was less technical, it played an important role in shaping my character and professionalism. It helped me understand that integrity is a crucial element in building trust and credibility in any career path.
