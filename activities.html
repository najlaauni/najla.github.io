    <h2>🧭 Overview</h2>
    <p>
        My life as a student in UTM was colorful, always filled with educational activities besides the normal lectures and classes. 
        The list of my active participation in activities included various contests, offering help, being a leader, being a member of a club, and 
        attending talks and events organized by the faculty.<br>

        With respect to the academic and industrial discussions, I was through the lectures of Future of Industry (FOI) and Quantum that kept me up-to-date 
        with the recent trends as well as the technological forecasts of computing and engineering. 
        In addition, I had the opportunity to work as a crew member for SUSKOM'25 and CODE'26 where I was involved in the 
        entire process of the event preparation, coordination and supporting the event. The activities gave me the chance to mingle with the university 
        community outside the classroom and see how academic and large-scale student events are organized.

<h2>🪞 Overall Reflection</h2>
<p>
Overall, as a first-year student, my being involved in the activities at UTM has been one of the main factors contributing to both my personal and professional growth. Participation in academics talks such as FOI and Quantum was so enlightening that they lifted the veil over the future of technology and also allowed me to see how the theoretical knowledge is of use in the industries. Working with SUSKOM and being part of the crew for CODE increased my capabilities in teamwork, communication, and problem-solving, especially in high-paced and cooperative environments.
<br>
The combination of academic duties and co-curricular activities was a tough nut to crack but it turned me into a master of time management, adaptability, and discipline. I went through these experiences and came out with a much higher self-esteem in the fields of communication, accountability, and participation in group situations. I think these things have been the main academic learning and have significantly contributed to my transformation into a more flexible and self-assured student, hence preparing me for the upcoming educational and career challenges.
